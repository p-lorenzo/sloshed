# Sloshed

Sloshed is a Unity-based game prototype developed for the GameDev.js Jam 2025, designed around the theme of "balance". You control a character with drunken, ragdoll-like movement in a domestic environment filled with oversized furniture and challenges. The project leverages custom shaders, physics-based interactions, and procedural level design.
